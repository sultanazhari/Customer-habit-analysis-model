# Customer-habit-analysis-model

# Project description
Mobile operator Megaline was dissatisfied that most of their customers were still on the old plan. The company wanted to develop a model that could analyze consumer behavior and recommend one of Megaline's two new plans: Smart or Ultra.

You have access to behavioral data of customers who have switched to the new plan (from the Statistical Data Analysis course project). In this classification task, you need to develop a model that is able to select the right plan. Now that you have completed the data pre-processing step, you can move on to the model building stage.

Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Don't forget to check the accuracy of your model using a test dataset.
